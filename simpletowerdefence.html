    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>This is the first game I ever made and was made in game maker. The game was made for a class in highshool.
       the game doesn't realy have an official name so i just called it by what it is, a simple tower defence game.
       the original idea was much more grand but was also way beyond my abilities at the time so I simpliefied 
       it to keep within scope. the game is heavily inspired by the various games in the kingdom rush seires
    </p>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>the game has 10 waves of increasing difficulty. The plalyer must fend of all waves using various towers. each tower
       costs a different amount and each has an upgrade that improves them. the towers can only be placed in the specified places
       so the options for placement are much more limited than a game like bloons tower defence. as towers defeat enemies,
       you gain money to be used to improve your defences and prepare for stronger enemies. the game ends once you beat all
       waves of sucumb to the enemies assault.
    </p>

    <h3>The Original Plan</h3>
    <p>my original plan for the game I wanted to make was a merging tower denfence. the plan was for each tower to have
       2 upgrades untill you merged it with another tower, creating a unique tower that was the combination of both.
       This tower could then be upgraded to either lean more towards one base tower or the other and would now have
       two upgrade paths that each go upto lever 4, with the other path only being abel to go to the base level 2. other
       than that the game would be pretty much the same as the end result. I was going to give the merging tower defence
       game a artificer themeing with the player being a artificer and that is why they are merging towers.

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>the main lesson from this project is being careful of scope. from the start I knew that I only had one semester to
       make the game so making the originaly planned game was not feesible. since this was my first game i had no idea how
       much time and effort it takes to make a game and I am definitely better at judging if something is beyond scope or not now.
       This game also helped me learn the basics of game engines, mainly object interactions and deciding what object stores what data.
       I mainly use Godot now so while some of what I learned about the game engine didn't transfer to later projects,
       just knowing some of the basics of what to expect a game engine to have was deinitely helpful for learning other game engines.
