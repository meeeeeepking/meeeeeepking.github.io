    <h1>Melody</h1>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>In melody, you play as a ghost trying to get from the graveyard to the city. the game was made durring a summer camp
        and is meant to just be a proof of concept. the game was made in unreal engine since that is what we were 
        reuquired to use for the summer camp, despite this the game is 2d since that was what the people who originaly 
        came up with the idea for the game wanted. I was brought onto the team to be the programmer actualy implementing
        the game since the rest of the team were artists. This was my first time ussing unreal engine so the end production
        is full of bugs and very incomplete since we only had 2 weeks to make the game and had other things to do durring the
        summer camp so we didn't too much time to work on it. 
    </p>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>you are a ghost that can move side to side and jump. to help you traverse the obstacles, you can sing to make
      note platforms and attack enemies.  when you are singing, the notes will come out whichever way you are facing.
      if you hold down the one of the singing buttons (the singing buttons are Y U I O P) you make longer and longer notes untill you get to a whole notes which
      is placed in the world as a temporary platform. the position of the notes is based on your facing direction and the
      pitch of your singing with "Y" being highest pitch and thus highest up and "P" being lowest pitch and thus farthest down.
      releasing the button launches the current note as an attack which is how you can damage the boss at the end of the game.
      this boss is located after the platforming section. as a rule of thumb when playing the game, you always are trying to get further to the right.

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>most htings about this project had me learning new things. for one, this was my first time ussing unreal engine
      so i had to learn how to use that, with the added level of dificulty that we were making a 2D game. This was also my first 
      time working with artists on a game so the bigest learning point was collaboration. we were all very new to our roles 
      so there was a lot of struggle geting the correct file formats for sprites and the like at first but we got the hang
      of it by the end of the 2 week summer camp. we also all learned a lot about time managment and scope creep since
      we kept on having ideas that just couldnt be done in time so i had to veto several adittions that i just couldn't implement
      as the only programmer.
